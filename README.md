## Weather Dashboard

### Project Description

This is a UPenn Coding Bootcamp module challenge. It is a weather app includes the use of openweathermap.org api to get the current weather conditions and a 5 day weather forecast of the city that is inputted through the search bar. This was created from scratch with bootstrap and heavily influenced by templates that I found online along with consulting google and chatGPT for help when writing the code and there were errors.
